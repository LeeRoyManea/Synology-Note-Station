If you want to run Synology Note Station on Fedora or other distros like me,
you can use my script and flatpak manifest to install it.

Dependencies:
- flatpak-builder
- org.freedesktop.Platform 22.08

Installation:
1. clone projekt 
2. cd into the folder
3. chmod +x install.sh
4. ./install.sh

Todos:
Update manifest.json to work without install.sh
Publish on Flathub
